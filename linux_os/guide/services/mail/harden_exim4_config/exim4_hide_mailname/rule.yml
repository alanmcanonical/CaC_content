title: 'Ensure EXIM4 is configured to not hide mailname'

description: |-
    Mail Transfer Agents (MTA), such as sendmail and Postfix, are used to
    listen for incoming mail and transfer the messages to the appropriate
    user or mail server. If the system is not intended to be a mail server,
    it is recommended that the MTA be configured to only process local mail.

rationale: |-
    The software for all Mail Transfer Agents is complex and most have a long
    history of security issues. While it is important to ensure that the
    system can process local mail messages, it is not necessary to have the
    MTA's daemon listening on a port unless the server is intended to be a
    mail server that receives and processes mail from other systems.

    Note: This recommendation is designed around the exim4 mail server,
    depending on your environment you may have an alternative MTA installed
    such as sendmail. If this is the case consult the documentation for your
    installed MTA to configure the recommended state.
