title: 'Ensure mail transfer agent is configured for local-only mode'

description: |-
    Mail Transfer Agents (MTA), such as sendmail and Postfix, are used to listen for incoming
    mail and transfer the messages to the appropriate user or mail server. If the system is not
    intended to be a mail server, it is recommended that the MTA be configured to only process
    local mail.

rationale: |-
    The software for all Mail Transfer Agents is complex and most have a long history of
    security issues. While it is important to ensure that the system can process local mail
    messages, it is not necessary to have the MTA's daemon listening on a port unless the
    server is intended to be a mail server that receives and processes mail from other systems.
