title: 'The Chrony package is removed'

description: |-
    System time should be synchronized between all systems in an environment. This is
    typically done by establishing an authoritative time server or set of servers and having all
    systems synchronize their clocks to them.
    {{{ describe_package_remove(package="chrony") }}}

rationale: |-
    Time synchronization is important to support time sensitive security mechanisms like
    Kerberos and also ensures log files have consistent time records across the enterprise,
    which aids in forensic investigations.
