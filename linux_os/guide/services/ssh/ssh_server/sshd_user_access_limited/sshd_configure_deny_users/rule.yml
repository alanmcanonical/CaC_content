title: 'Restrict sshd user access via DenyUsers'

description: |-
    DenyUsers gives the system administrator the option of denying specific users to
    ssh into the system.

    - The list consists of space separated user names
    - Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this variable
    - A system administrator may restrict user access further by only allowing the
      allowed users to log in from a particular host by specifying the entry as
      user@host.

rationale: |-
    Restricting which users can remotely access the system via SSH will help ensure that only
    authorized users access the system.
