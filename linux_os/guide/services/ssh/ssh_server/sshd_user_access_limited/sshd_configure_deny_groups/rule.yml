title: 'Restrict sshd user access via DenyGroups'

description: |-
    DenyGroups gives the system administrator the option of denying specific groups to
    ssh into the system.

    - The list consists of space separated group names.
    - Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable.

rationale: |-
    Restricting which users can remotely access the system via SSH will help ensure that only
    authorized users access the system.
