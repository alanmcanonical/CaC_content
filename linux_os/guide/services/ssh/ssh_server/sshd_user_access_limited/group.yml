title: 'Ensure SSH Access is Limited'

description: |-
    There are several options available to limit which users and group can access the system
    via SSH. It is recommended that at least one of the following options be leveraged:
    - AllowUsers - Gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific users to
      ssh into the system.
      - The list consists of space separated user names
      - Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this variable
      - A system administrator may restrict user access further by only allowing the
        allowed users to log in from a particular host by specifying the entry as
        user@host
    - AllowGroups - Gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific groups
      of users to ssh into the system
      - The list consists of space separated group names
      - Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable
    - DenyUsers - Gives the system administrator the option of denying specific users to
      ssh into the system
      - The list consists of space separated user names
      - Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this variable
      - If a system administrator wants to restrict user access further by specifically
        denying a user's access from a particular host by specifying the entry as
        user@host
    - DenyGroups - Gives the system administrator the option of denying specific groups
      of users to ssh into the system
      - The list consists of space separated group names
      - Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable

    Restricting which users can remotely access the system via SSH will help ensure that only
    authorized users access the system.
