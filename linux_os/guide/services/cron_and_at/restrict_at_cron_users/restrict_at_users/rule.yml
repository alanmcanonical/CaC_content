title: 'Ensure at is restricted to authorized users'

description: |-
    Configure /etc/at.allow to allow specific users to use these services. If
    /etc/at.allow do not exist, then /etc/at.deny is checked. Any user not
    specifically defined in these file is allowed to use at. By removing the
    file, only users in /etc/at.allow is allowed to use at.

    Note: Other methods, such as systemd timers , exist for scheduling jobs. If another method is
    used, at should be removed, and the alternate method should be secured in accordance with
    local site policy.

rationale: |-
    On many systems, only the system administrator is authorized to schedule at jobs. Using
    the at.allow file to control who can run at jobs enforces this policy. It is easier to manage
    an allow list than a deny list. In a deny list, you could potentially add a user ID to the system
    and forget to add it to the deny files.
