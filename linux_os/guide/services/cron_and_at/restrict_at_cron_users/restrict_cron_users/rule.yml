title: 'Ensure cron is restricted to authorized users'

description: |-
    Configure /etc/cron.allow to allow specific users to use these services. If
    /etc/cron.allow do not exist, then /etc/cron.deny is checked. Any user not
    specifically defined in these file is allowed to use cron. By removing the
    file, only users in /etc/cron.allow is allowed to use cron.

    Notes:
     - Other methods, such as systemd timers, exist for scheduling jobs. If another method is
       used, cron should be removed, and the alternate method should be secured in
       accordance with local site policy.
     - Even though a given user is not listed in cron.allow, cron jobs can still be run as that
       user.
     - The cron.allow file only controls administrative access to the crontab command for
       scheduling and modifying cron jobs.

rationale: |-
    On many systems, only the system administrator is authorized to schedule cron jobs. Using
    the cron.allow file to control who can run cron jobs enforces this policy. It is easier to
    manage an allow list than a deny list. In a deny list, you could potentially add a user ID to
    the system and forget to add it to the deny files.
