title: 'Configure journald'

description: |-
    systemd-journald is a system service that collects and stores logging
    data. It creates and maintains structured, indexed journals based on
    logging information that is received from a variety of sources:

     - Kernel log messages, via kmsg
     - Simple system log messages, via the libc syslog(3) call
     - Structured system log messages via the native Journal API, see sd_journal_print(3)
     - Standard output and standard error of service units. For further details see below.
     - Audit records, originating from the kernel audit subsystem.

    The daemon will implicitly collect numerous metadata fields for each log messages in a
    secure and unfakeable way. See systemd.journal-fields(7) for more information about the
    collected metadata.

    Log data collected by the journal is primarily text-based but can also include binary
    data where necessary. Individual fields making up a log record stored in the journal
    may be up to 2^64-1 bytes in size.
