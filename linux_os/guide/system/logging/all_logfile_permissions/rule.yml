title: 'Ensure permissions on all logfiles are configured'

description: |-
    Log files stored in /var/log/ contain logged information from many services on the system,
    or on log hosts others as well.

    Note: You may also need to change the configuration for your logging software or services for
    any logs that had incorrect permissions.

rationale: |-
    It is important to ensure that log files have the correct permissions to ensure
    that sensitive data is archived and protected.
