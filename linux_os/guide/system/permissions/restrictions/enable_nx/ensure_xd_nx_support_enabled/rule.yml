title: 'Ensure XD/NX support is enabled'

description: |-
    Recent processors in the x86 family support the ability to prevent code
    execution on a per memory page basis. Generically and on AMD processors,
    this ability is called No Execute (NX), while on Intel processors it is
    called Execute Disable (XD). This ability can help prevent exploitation of
    buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever possible.
    Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled,
    particularly on 32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and
    POWER, have included such support since inception and the standard kernel
    for those platforms supports the feature.

    Note: Ensure your system supports the XD or NX bit and has PAE support
    before implementing this recommendation as this may prevent it from
    booting if these are not supported by your hardware.

rationale: |-
    Enabling any feature that can protect against buffer overflow attacks
    enhances the security of the system.
