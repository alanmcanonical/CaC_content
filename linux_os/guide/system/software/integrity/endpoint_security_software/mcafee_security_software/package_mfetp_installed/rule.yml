title: 'Install Endpoint Security for Linux Threat Prevention'

description: |-
    The operating system must deploy Endpoint Security for Linux Threat
    Prevention (ENSLTP).

rationale: |-
    Without the use of automated mechanisms to scan for security flaws on a
    continuous and/or periodic basis, the operating system or other system
    components may remain vulnerable to the exploits presented by
    undetected software flaws.
    To support this requirement, the operating system may have an integrated
    solution incorporating continuous scanning using HBSS and periodic
    scanning using other tools, as specified in the requirement.
