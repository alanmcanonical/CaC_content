title: Ensure loopback traffic is configured

description: |-
    Configure the loopback interface to accept traffic. Configure all other
    interfaces to deny traffic to the loopback network (127.0.0.0/8 for
    IPv4 and ::1/128 for IPv6).

    Loopback traffic is generated between processes on machine and is
    typically critical to operation of the system. The loopback interface is
    the only place that loopback network (127.0.0.0/8 for IPv4 and ::1/128
    for IPv6) traffic should be seen, all other interfaces should ignore
    traffic on this network as an anti-spoofing measure.
