title: 'Ensure default deny firewall policy - iptables6'

description: |-
    With a default accept policy the firewall will accept any packet that is not
    configured to be denied. It is easier to white list acceptable usage than
    to black list unacceptable usage.

    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out of the system</li>
      <li>Remediation will only affect the active system firewall, be sure to configure the default policy in your firewall management to apply on boot as well.</li>
    </ul>
