title: 'Ensure a table exists'

description: |-
    Tables hold chains. Each table only has one address family and only applies to packets of
    this family. Tables can have one of five families.

rationale: |-
    nftables doesn't have any default tables. Without a table being build, nftables
    will not filter network traffic.

platforms:
  - var_nftables
