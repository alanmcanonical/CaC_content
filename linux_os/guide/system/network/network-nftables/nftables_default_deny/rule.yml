title: 'Ensure default deny firewall policy'

description: |-
    Base chain policy is the default verdict that will be applied to packets reaching the end of
    the chain.

rationale: |-
    There are two policies: accept (Default) and drop. If the policy is set to
    accept, the firewall will accept any packet that is not configured to be
    denied and the packet will continue transversing the network stack. It is
    easier to white list acceptable usage than to black list unacceptable
    usage.
