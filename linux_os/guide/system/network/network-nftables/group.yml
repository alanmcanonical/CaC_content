title: nftables

description: |-
    nftables replaces the popular {ip,ip6,arp,eb}tables. This software provides a
    new in-kernel packet classification framework that is based on a network-specific
    Virtual Machine (VM) and a new nft userspace command line tool. nftables reuses
    the existing Netfilter subsystems such as the existing hook infrastructure, the
    connection tracking system, NAT, userspace queueing and logging subsystem.

    This software also provides libnftables, the high-level userspace library that
    includes support for JSON, see man (3) libnftables for more information.
