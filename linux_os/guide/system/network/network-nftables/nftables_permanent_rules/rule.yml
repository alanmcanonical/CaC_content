title: 'Ensure nftables rules are permanent'

description: |-
    nftables is a subsystem of the Linux kernel providing filtering and classification of network
    packets/datagrams/frames.

    The nftables service reads the /etc/nftables.conf file for a nftables file or files to include
    in the nftables ruleset.

    A nftables ruleset containing the input, forward, and output base chains allow network
    traffic to be filtered.

rationale: |-
    Changes made to nftables ruleset only affect the live system, you will also
    need to configure the nftables ruleset to apply on boot.
