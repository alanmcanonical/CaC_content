title: 'Ensure base chains exist'

description: |-
    Chains are containers for rules. They exist in two kinds, base chains and regular chains. A
    base chain is an entry point for packets from the networking stack, a regular chain may be
    used as jump target and is used for better rule organization.

rationale: |-
    If a base chain doesn't exist with a hook for input, forward, and delete,
    packets that would flow through those chains will not be touched by
    nftables.

platforms:
  - var_nftables
  - machine
