title: 'Ensure default deny firewall policy'

description: |-
    A default deny policy on connections ensures that any unconfigured network usage will be
    rejected.

    Note: Any port or protocol without a explicit allow before the default deny will be blocked.

rationale: |-
    With a default accept policy the firewall will accept any packet that is not
    configured to be denied. It is easier to allow acceptable usage than to block
    unacceptable usage.
