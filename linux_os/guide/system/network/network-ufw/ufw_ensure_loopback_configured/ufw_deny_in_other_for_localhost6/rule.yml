title: 'Inbound traffic for ::1/128 on any other interface is denied.'

description: |-
    UFW should be configured to forbid all traffic for the localhost6 addresses
    (::1/128) on interfaces other than the designated lo interface.

rationale: |-
    A properly configured system expects communication on the loopback
    interface to be secure and only accessible to the local system.
