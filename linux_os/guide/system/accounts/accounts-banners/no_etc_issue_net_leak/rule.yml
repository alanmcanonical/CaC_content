title: 'Ensure remote login warning banner is configured properly'

description: |-
    The contents of the /etc/issue.net file are displayed to users prior to login
    for remote connections from configured services.

    Unix-based systems have typically displayed information about the OS release
    and patch level upon logging in to the system. This information can be useful
    to developers who are developing software for a particular OS platform. If mingetty(8)
    supports the following options, they display operating system information:
    \m - machine architecture \r - operating system release \s - operating
    system name \v - operating system version

rationale: |-
    Warning messages inform users who are attempting to login to the system of their legal
    status regarding the system and must include the name of the organization that owns the
    system and any monitoring policies that are in place. Displaying OS and patch level
    information in login banners also has the side effect of providing detailed system
    information to attackers attempting to target specific exploits of a system. Authorized users
    can easily get this information by running the "uname -a" command once they have logged
    in.
