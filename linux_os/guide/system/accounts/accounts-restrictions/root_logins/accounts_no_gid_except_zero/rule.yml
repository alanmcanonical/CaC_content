title: 'Ensure default group for the root account is GID 0'

description: |-
    The usermod command can be used to specify which group the root user belongs
    to. This affects permissions of files that are created by the root user.
    Using GID 0 for the root account helps prevent root-owned files from
    accidentally becoming accessible to non-privileged users.

rationale: |-
    Using GID 0 for the root account helps prevent root -owned files from accidentally
    becoming accessible to non-privileged users.
