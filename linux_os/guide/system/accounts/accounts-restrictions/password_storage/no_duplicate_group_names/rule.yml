title: 'Ensure no duplicate group names exist'

description: |-
    Although the groupadd program will not let you create a duplicate group name,
    it is possible for an administrator to manually edit the /etc/group file
    and change the group name. If a group is assigned a duplicate group name,
    it will create and have access to files with the first GID for that group
    in /etc/group . Effectively, the GID is shared, which is a security
    problem.
