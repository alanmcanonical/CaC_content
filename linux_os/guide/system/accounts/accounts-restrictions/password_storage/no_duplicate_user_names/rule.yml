title: 'Ensure no duplicate user names exist'

description: |-
    Although the useradd program will not let you create a duplicate user name, it
    is possible for an administrator to manually edit the /etc/passwd file and
    change the user name. If a user is assigned a duplicate user name, it will
    create and have access to files with the first UID for that username in
    /etc/passwd . For example, if "test4" has a UID of 1000 and a subsequent
    "test4" entry has a UID of 2000, logging in as "test4" will use UID 1000.
    Effectively, the UID is shared, which is a security problem.
