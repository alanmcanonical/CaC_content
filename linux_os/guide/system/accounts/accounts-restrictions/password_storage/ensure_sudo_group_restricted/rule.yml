title: 'Ensure sudo group has only necessary members'

description: |-
    Developers and implementers can increase the assurance in security
    functions by employing well-defined security policy models; structured,
    disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development techniques;
    and sound system/security engineering principles. Implementation may
    include isolation of memory space and libraries.

    The Ubuntu operating system restricts access to security functions
    through the use of access control mechanisms and by implementing least
    privilege capabilities.

rationale: |-
    Any users assigned to the sudo group would be granted administrator
    access to the system.
