title: 'Ensure no duplicate GIDs exist'

description: |-
    Although the groupadd program will not let you create a duplicate Group ID
    (GID), it is possible for an administrator to manually edit the /etc/group
    file and change the GID field. User groups must be assigned unique GIDs for
    accountability and to ensure appropriate access protections.

rationale: |-
    User groups must be assigned unique GIDs for accountability and to ensure appropriate
    access protections.
