title: 'Ensure all groups in /etc/passwd exist in /etc/group'

description: |-
    Over time, system administration errors and changes can lead to groups being
    defined in /etc/passwd but not in /etc/group . Groups defined in the
    /etc/passwd file but not in the /etc/group file pose a threat to system
    security since group permissions are not properly managed.
