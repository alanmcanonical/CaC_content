title: 'Ensure shadow group is empty'

description: |-
    The shadow group allows system programs which require access the ability to
    read the /etc/shadow file. No users should be assigned to the shadow group.
    Any users assigned to the shadow group would be granted read access to the
    /etc/shadow file. If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/shadow
    file, they can easily run a password cracking program against the hashed
    passwords to break them. Other security information that is stored in the
    /etc/shadow file (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert
    additional user accounts.
