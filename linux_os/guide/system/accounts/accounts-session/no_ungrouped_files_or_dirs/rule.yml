title: 'Ensure no ungrouped files or directories exist'

description: |-
    Sometimes when administrators delete users or groups from the system they
    neglect to remove all files owned by those users or groups. A new user who
    is assigned the deleted user's user ID or group ID may then end up "owning"
    these files, and thus have more access on the system than was intended.
