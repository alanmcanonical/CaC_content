title: 'Ensure no users have .forward files'

    The .forward file specifies an email address to forward the user's mail to. Use
    of the .forward file poses a security risk in that sensitive data may be
    inadvertently transferred outside the organization. The .forward file also
    poses a risk as it can be used to execute commands that may perform
    unintended actions.
